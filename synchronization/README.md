# Synchronization

A collection of demos that show basic synchronization (or lack of) in Java.

1. `sync-method` - shows using a synchronized method
2. `sync-block` - shows using synchronized blocks
3. `no-sync` - you guessed it, doesn't synchronize
4. `volatile` - doesn't synchronize, but attempts to use the volatile keyword
