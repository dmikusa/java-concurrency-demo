# Java Util Concurrent

A collection of demos using `java.util.concurrent`. This is by no means a complete set of what you can do with `java.util.concurrent`, but it shows some of the most often used items.

1. `atomics` - uses an atomic type with multiple threads
2. `thread-pool` - same as `atomics`, but manages threads with an `ExecutorService`
3. `producer-consumer` - reimplements the producer/consumer example using concurrent collections
4. `parallel-streams` - shows how you can use parallel streams to make easily parallelizable tasks faster
5. `schedule-task` - shows how to schedule tasks to run at different intervals
